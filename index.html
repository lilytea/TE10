      ARTIST"S STATEMENT<br><br>
      The world becomes so big if we shrink ourselves. I have a fantasy that future technology can make the creatures on the earth grow bigger or shrink at any time. In this way, we don't need to consume so many earth resources. I remembered the story of Alice in Wonderland. Alice follows a rabbit to the hole and becomes smaller after drinking a drink, and the objects around her became bigger. I think that when the objects around us become bigger, daily objects can become our playground, such as shoes become slides, clocks become monkey bars and bananas become seesaws. We can play within them. I found it very interesting, so I created this project.
